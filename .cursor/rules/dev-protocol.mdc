# FIGS Claims Interpreter - Autonomous AI Development Protocol

**CRITICAL:** This document contains MANDATORY rules for autonomous AI agents developing this project. **FOLLOW EVERY RULE EXACTLY.**

---

## 🔒 MANDATORY PROTOCOL RULES

### RULE 1: DOCUMENTATION CONSULTATION (REQUIRED BEFORE EVERY TASK)
```
BEFORE starting ANY task, you MUST:
1. Read docs/srs.md (Software Requirements Specification) completely
2. Read docs/blueprint.md (Software Blueprint) completely  
3. Read docs/content-strategy.md (Content Strategy & Information Architecture) completely
4. Read docs/developer-checklist.md (Developer Checklist) completely
5. Locate the specific task in the Developer Checklist
6. Understand the task's dependencies and requirements
7. Confirm you understand what "done" means for this task

DOCUMENTATION FILE STRUCTURE:
docs/
├── srs.md                    # Software Requirements Specification
├── blueprint.md              # Software Blueprint & Implementation Guide  
├── content-strategy.md       # Content Strategy & Information Architecture
├── developer-checklist.md    # Developer Checklist (THIS FILE GETS UPDATED)
├── design-refinement.md      # Design Refinement Guide (reference only)
└── autonomous-protocol.md    # This protocol document

IF you cannot access or understand ANY documentation, STOP and report the issue.
```

### RULE 2: SINGLE TASK EXECUTION (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT)
```
YOU MUST ONLY WORK ON ONE TASK AT A TIME:
1. Select the next uncompleted task from the Developer Checklist
2. Complete that task entirely before moving to any other task
3. Do NOT start multiple tasks simultaneously
4. Do NOT skip tasks unless explicitly marked as dependencies

VIOLATION OF THIS RULE STOPS ALL DEVELOPMENT.
```

### RULE 3: DEPENDENCY VERIFICATION (MANDATORY BEFORE EACH TASK)
```
BEFORE starting any task, you MUST:
1. Check the task's listed dependencies in the Developer Checklist
2. Verify ALL dependency tasks are marked as completed (with checkmark)
3. If ANY dependency is incomplete, STOP and complete dependencies first
4. Document which dependencies you verified

EXAMPLE:
Task P0-003 depends on P0-002
- Check: Is P0-002 marked complete? 
- If YES, proceed with P0-003
- If NO, complete P0-002 first
```

### RULE 4: TASK COMPLETION VERIFICATION (REQUIRED FOR EVERY TASK)
```
After completing each task, you MUST verify ALL completion criteria:

1. Code is written and tested locally
2. TypeScript compilation passes with no errors  
3. ESLint and Prettier checks pass
4. Component renders without console errors
5. Basic functionality works as specified
6. Code is committed to version control

ALL criteria must be satisfied before marking task complete.
```

### RULE 5: TASK MARKING PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
```
When a task is completed, you MUST:
1. Update the docs/developer-checklist.md file
2. Change [ ] to [✓] for the completed task
3. Update the progress counter for that phase
4. Add completion timestamp in format: [✓ YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
5. Commit the updated checklist to version control

EXAMPLE:
- [✓ 2025-07-13 14:30] **P0-001** Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
```

### RULE 6: COMMIT PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
```
You MUST commit to version control:
1. After completing EVERY individual task
2. After completing each PHASE entirely
3. Before moving to the next phase
4. When encountering any blocking issues

COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT:
"feat: [TASK-ID] - [Brief description]

- Completed task: [Task Name]
- Phase: [Phase Number]
- Dependencies verified: [List]
- All completion criteria met: Yes

[Additional details if needed]"

EXAMPLE:
"feat: P0-001 - Initialize Next.js project

- Completed task: Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript  
- Phase: 1
- Dependencies verified: None (first task)
- All completion criteria met: Yes

Project structure created, TypeScript configured, dev server verified working."
```

### RULE 7: CONSECUTIVE ERROR HANDLING PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
```
When encountering errors with commands or operations:

ATTEMPT RESOLUTION UP TO 2 TIMES:
1. First error: Try reasonable alternative or fix
2. Second error: Try one more alternative approach
3. Third error: STOP and request human intervention

WHEN REQUESTING HUMAN INTERVENTION:
1. STOP all development immediately
2. Document all attempted solutions
3. Document the exact errors encountered
4. Create detailed instructions for human overseer
5. Commit current progress with clear status
6. Wait for human intervention to resolve

HUMAN INTERVENTION REQUEST FORMAT:
"pause: Multiple errors encountered for [TASK-ID]

- Task: [Task Name]
- Command/operation failing: [exact command or operation]
- Attempts made:
  1. [First attempt and error]
  2. [Second attempt and error]  
  3. [Third attempt and error]
- Current status: Blocked after 3 consecutive errors
- Next steps needed: [what human should investigate/resolve]

Please resolve the issue and confirm when ready to continue."
```

### RULE 8: ERROR HANDLING PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
```
When encountering ANY error or blocker:
1. STOP all development immediately
2. Document the exact error message
3. Document what you were attempting to do
4. Document which task you were working on
5. Commit current progress with error details
6. Create an issue report with full context
7. DO NOT attempt to skip or work around errors

ERROR COMMIT FORMAT:
"error: [TASK-ID] - [Error description]

- Task attempted: [Task Name]
- Error encountered: [Exact error message]
- Steps taken: [What you tried]
- Current status: Blocked
- Next action required: [What needs to be resolved]"
```

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### BEFORE STARTING ANY WORK
```
STEP 1: Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Verify you can access all documentation files in docs/ folder:
   - docs/srs.md (Software Requirements Specification)
   - docs/blueprint.md (Software Blueprint)
   - docs/content-strategy.md (Content Strategy & Information Architecture)
   - docs/developer-checklist.md (Developer Checklist)

STEP 2: Initial Documentation Review  
1. Read docs/srs.md completely - understand ALL requirements
2. Read docs/blueprint.md completely - understand architecture  
3. Read docs/content-strategy.md - understand all page content
4. Study docs/developer-checklist.md - understand task flow
5. Identify the first uncompleted task

STEP 3: First Task Verification
1. Confirm P0-001 is the first task to complete
2. Verify P0-001 has no dependencies (it's the first task)
3. Read P0-001 task description thoroughly
4. Understand what "done" means for P0-001
```
